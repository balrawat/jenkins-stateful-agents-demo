# jenkins-stateful-agents-demo

This repository contains files needed to run through our demo for deploying 1) a Jenkins master, and 2) a Jenkins agent with a persistent volume.

The background and instructions for this demo can be found on our blog, here: [Improve Build Times on Kubernetes-Based Jenkins with Stateful Agents](https://hiya.com/blog/2017/10/02/kubernetes-base-jenkins-stateful-agents/)
